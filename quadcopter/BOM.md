# Open Multi Copter - Quad BoM #

## Bill Of Materials ##

> All the components that I used for building up this quad copter has been purchased from [rci-innovations.com](rci-innovations.com "RC-Innovations") or [http://www.hobbyking.com](http://www.hobbyking.com "Hobbyking"). Nevertheless, as this project is parametrizable, you can use any component you want and adapt the copter chassis to it.
